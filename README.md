# RetroFutureLorenzAttractor
## About
This project was an experiment using JavaScript's canvas API and the Lorenz Attractor algorithm. Ultimately, I wound up
using two Lorenz Attractors with slightly different scales. Each point drawn was connected via a line to the other 
Lorenz Attractor's matching point, creating the 3D effect. Filling these spaces created the polygonal effect. You can
test it out for yourself [here](http://tuckerburke.com/Retro-Future-Lorenz-Attractor/).
